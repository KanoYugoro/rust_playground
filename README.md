# rust_playground
This is where I'm going to put rust code as I learn rust.

## prime_sieve
Generally when I learn languages that are different enough from what I already know, I write a simple (and usually messy) implementation of Euler's Sieve.
This is to get me used to the syntax of the language.  It's a simple algorithm to find prime numbers, but it touches variables, arrays, loops, and some
form of input and output.
